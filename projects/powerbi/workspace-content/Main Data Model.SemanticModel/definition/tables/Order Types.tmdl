	/// "Orders After Cutoff" - A legacy order type used by customer service to create an order for a customer after cut-off.
	/// "Orders After Registration" - A legacy order type which was only used on Godtlevert. It represented an order placed after signup.

There was a predetermined number of available orders of this type each week based on the amount of stock in PIM.
