    description: >
      Test to ensure that there is no overlap or gaps in price categories for a portion size within each company.
      This means that the max cost of one price category level should match the min cost of the next level.
      Hence, the data follows this structure:
      Price Category: 1 - min_cost: 49 - max_cost: 60
      Price Category: 2 - min_cost: 65 - max_cost: 70 -> GAP!!
      Price Category: 3 - min_cost: 70 - max_cost: 80
      Price Category: 4 - min_cost: 75 - max_cost: 100 -> OVERLAP!!
      etc
