## Setting Up Your Machine
This guide will help you set up your machine with the necessary tools to start developing with `sous-chef`. It will go through the following steps:

- Python and `pyenv` installation
- Poetry installation
- Git installation
- `sous-chef` cloning
- `sous-chef` CLI installation

A lot of the setup steps will need to be run in powershell or terminal. If you use VSCode, we recommend opening a new terminal in VSCode by selecting Terminal > New Terminal. Otherwise, you can open a new terminal by pressing `cmd + shift + p` and selecting `View > Terminal`.

### 1. Setting up GitHub
Start by making sure your GitHub account is set up correctly.

1. Configure two-factor authentication in your GitHub [profile settings](https://github.com/settings/security).
    - We recommend using the GitHib Mobile app ([iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/github/id1477376905) / [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.github.android&hl=en)) for this, but you can also use another authentication method.
2. If your GitHub account isn't set up with your `cheffelo.com` email address, then you need to add it in your [profile settings](https://github.com/settings/emails).

### 2. Installing VSCode and relevant extensions
You need a code editor to work on the code. We recommend using VSCode.

1. Go to https://code.visualstudio.com/download and install the version for your machine.
2. Install the following extensions in VSCode:
  - [Power user for dbt](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=innoverio.vscode-dbt-power-user)
  - [Databricks](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=databricks.databricks)
  - [TMDL](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=analysis-services.TMDL)
  - [PowerBI Studio](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GerhardBrueckl.powerbi-vscode)
  - [DAX for PowerBI](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=jianfajun.dax-language)

### 3. Install Python
Python is the back-bone of `sous-chef`, so we need to install this first. But each project can have different Python versions. Therefore, we will also install `pyenv` to manage different Python versions on your local machine.

#### On Windows:
1. Install pyenv-win in PowerShell.

```powershell
Invoke-WebRequest -UseBasicParsing -Uri "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pyenv-win/pyenv-win/master/pyenv-win/install-pyenv-win.ps1" -OutFile "./install-pyenv-win.ps1"; &"./install-pyenv-win.ps1"
```

2. Reopen PowerShell

3. Check if the installation was successful.
```
pyenv --version
```

4. Add pyenv to your path

Adding new environment variables.
```powershell
[System.Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable('PYENV',$env:USERPROFILE + "\.pyenv\pyenv-win\","User")

[System.Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable('PYENV_ROOT',$env:USERPROFILE + "\.pyenv\pyenv-win\","User")

[System.Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable('PYENV_HOME',$env:USERPROFILE + "\.pyenv\pyenv-win\","User")
```

Adding the environment variables to the path.
```powershell
[System.Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable('path', $env:USERPROFILE + "\.pyenv\pyenv-win\bin;" + $env:USERPROFILE + "\.pyenv\pyenv-win\shims;" + [System.Environment]::GetEnvironmentVariable('path', "User"),"User")
```

5. Check a list of Python versions supported by `pyenv-win`
```
pyenv install -l
```

6. Install python 3.11
```
pyenv install 3.11.5
```

7. Set a Python version as the global version

```
pyenv global 3.11.5
```

8. Check which Python version you are using and its path

```
pyenv version
```
Output: `<version> (set by \path\to\.pyenv\pyenv-win\.python-version)`

9. Check that Python is working

```
python -c "import sys; print(sys.executable)"
```
Output: `\path\to\.pyenv\pyenv-win\versions\<version>\python.exe`

#### On macOS:
We will install `pyenv` and Python using Homebrew.

1. Install Homebrew if you haven't already
  ```bash
    /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
  ```

2. Use Homebrew to install `pyenv`
  ```bash
    brew update
    brew install pyenv
  ```

3. Check that `pyenv` is installed correctly by running
```bash
pyenv --version
```

_It should return something like `pyenv 2.X.X`_

4. Add the following to your `.zshrc` file, this will enable `pyenv` in your terminal
```bash
echo 'export PYENV_ROOT="$HOME/.pyenv"' >> ~/.zshrc
echo '[[ -d $PYENV_ROOT/bin ]] && export PATH="$PYENV_ROOT/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc
echo 'eval "$(pyenv init -)"' >> ~/.zshrc
```

Then close your terminal and open a new one.

5. Install Xcode command line tools
```bash
xcode-select --install
```

6. Install `pyenv` dependencies
```bash
brew install openssl readline sqlite3 xz zlib tcl-tk
```

7. Check that `pyenv` is in your path
```bash
which pyenv
```

8. Check that `pyenv`'s shims directory is in your path
```bash
echo $PATH | grep --color=auto "$(pyenv root)/shims"
```

9. Install Python 3.11 using `pyenv`
```bash
pyenv install 3.11.5
```

10. Install Python 3.10 using `pyenv`
```bash
pyenv install 3.10.15
```

11. Set the global Python version to 3.11
```bash
pyenv global 3.11.5
```

12. Check that `pyenv`has versions available
```bash
pyenv versions
```

#### Check Python installation
To check that you have set up Python correctly, run the following command:
```bash
python --version
```

It should return something like `Python 3.11.X`

### 4. Install Poetry
Poetry is a tool for dependency management in Python projects. It helps manage project dependencies, virtual environments, and package publishing.

#### On Windows:

1. Install Poetry using the official installer in PowerShell
```powershell
(Invoke-WebRequest -Uri https://install.python-poetry.org -UseBasicParsing).Content | python -
```

2. Add Poetry to your PATH
Search for `Environment Variables` in your start menu, and select `Edit the system environment variables`.

Click on `Environment Variables`, and select `Path` and click `Edit`.

Click `New` and add the following path:
```
%APPDATA%\Python\Scripts
```

Restart your PowerShell.

3. Check that you have set up Poetry correctly
```bash
poetry --version
```

_It should return something like `Poetry version 1.8.X`_

4. Set poetry to prefer the currently active Python version

```bash
poetry config virtualenvs.prefer-active-python true
poetry config virtualenvs.in-project true
```

Note: running `poetry self update`on Windows may be problematic. If so, run a re-install of Poetry by running the following:
```powershell
(Invoke-WebRequest -Uri https://install.python-poetry.org -UseBasicParsing).Content | py -
```

#### On macOS:

1. Install Poetry using the official installer
```bash
curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 -
```

2. Add poetry to your path
```bash
echo 'export PATH="$HOME/.poetry/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc
```

3. Check that you have set up Poetry correctly
```bash
poetry --version
```

_It should return something like `Poetry version 1.8.X`_

4. Set poetry to prefer the currently active Python version and create project specific virtualenvs

```bash
poetry config virtualenvs.prefer-active-python true
poetry config virtualenvs.in-project true
```

### 5. Install Git
Git is a version control system that allows you to track changes to your code. It is essential for managing and collaborating on projects.

#### On Windows:
1. Visit https://git-scm.com/download/win
2. Download and run the Git installer for Windows.
3. There will be a lot of prompts to choose between. Choose the default options apart from the follows:
- Default branch name suffix: `main`
- Default editor: `VSCode`
4. Open command prompt and check that Git is installed correctly by running:
```
git --version
```
_It should return something like `git version 2.X.X`_

5. Install GitHub CLI
```
winget install --id github.cli
```
_Accept the source agreements when prompted_

#### On macOS:
1. Install Git
```
brew install git
```
2. Install GitHub CLI
```
brew install gh
```

#### Confugring git
Once git is installed, we should provide git with our full name and email address.

1. Start by setting your full name.

```
git config --global user.name "Your Full Name"
```

2. Set the email address, this should be the email address you use to access GitHub.

```
git config --global user.email "Your GitHub Email"
```

3. Set the pull strategy to only fast-forward.

_We recommend requiring git to only fast-forward when pulling, instead of trying (and potentially failing) to rebase. This will stop git from putting itself in a bad state._
```
git config --global pull.ff only
```

4. Check that you have set up git correctly:
```
git --version
```
_It should return something like `git version 2.X.X`_

#### Authenticate with GitHub

Before cloning the repository, you need to authenticate your local machine with GitHub. This step ensures that you have the necessary permissions to access the repository.

1. Authenticate with GitHub
   ```
   gh auth login
   ```

2. Follow the prompts to complete the authentication process using the following answers
  - What account do you want to log into? - GitHub.com
  - What is your preferred protocol for Git operations? - HTTPS
  - Authenticate Git with your GitHub credentials? - Yes
  - How would you like to authenticate GitHub CLI? - Login with a web browser

### 6. Clone Repo
Now let's get the sous-chef repo cloned to your local machine.

We recommend creating a directory within your home directory named `cheffelo` and place all of Cheffelo's source code repositories in there.

```
mkdir ~/cheffelo
cd ~/cheffelo
git clone https://github.com/cheffelo/sous-chef sous-chef
cd sous-chef
```

#### Windows: Adding the folder to avoid access issues on
There is an issue on Windows where "Windows Defender" blocks the access to the sous-chef folder by default. To fix this, we need to add the folder to the "Exclusions", to do this:

1. Go to Settings > Security > Virus & threat protection
2. Under Virus & threat protection settings select Manage settings
3. Under Exclusions select Add or remove exclusions
4. Select Add an exclusion
5. Choose Folder
6. Add the sous-chef folder

### 7. Installing pre-commit hooks
We use pre-commit hooks to ensure code quality and consistency across the monorepo.

#### On Windows:
1. Install pre-commit
```
pipx install pre-commit
```
2. Install the pre-commit hooks
```
cd cheffelo/sous-chef
pre-commit install
```

#### On macOS:
1. Install pre-commit
```
brew install pre-commit
```
2. Install the pre-commit hooks
```
cd cheffelo/sous-chef
pre-commit install
```

### 8. Activate the `chef` cli
Now we have the sous-chef report cloned. Let's install the dependencies and activate the `chef` cli.

Run the following commands to install the dependencies and activate the `chef` cli.

```bash
cd cheffelo/sous-chef
poetry shell
poetry install
```

This will spin up a new Python virtualenv, and activate the venv in a new shell.
It will also install the core utils (`chef`) to manage the monorepo.

If this was succesful, then you're fully set-up in sous-chef and can start working on projects.

To check that the `chef` cli is working, run the following command:
```bash
chef --help
```

_It should return a list of commands that you can use._

### 9. Setting up a project specific environment
We us pyenv to manage different Python versions, and Poetry to create virtualevns with the correct dependencies for each project.

Let's test creating a new Python environment for a project.

#### On macOS:

1. cd into a project
```bash
cd cheffelo/sous-chef/projects/data-model
```

2. Create a new virtualenv
```bash
poetry shell
```

3. Install the project dependencies
```bash
poetry install
```

4. Activate the virtualenv
```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
```

5. Check that you are in a virtualenv
```
which python
```
Should output something like:
```
/Users/<your-username>/cheffelo/sous-chef/projects/data-model/.venv/bin/python
```

#### On Windows:
1. cd into a project
```bash
cd cheffelo/sous-chef/projects/data-model
```

2. Create a new virtualenv
```bash
poetry shell
```

3. Install the project dependencies
```bash
poetry install
```

4. Check that you are in a virtualenv
```
which python
```
Should output something like:
```
/Users/<your-username>/cheffelo/sous-chef/projects/data-model/.venv/bin/python
```

### 10. Connecting to Databricks locally (NOT COMPLETE YET)
If you want to run local code in Databricks, you need to first connect to Databricks using the Databricks extension in VSCode.

1. Click on the Databricks logo in the left-hand side of VSCode.
2. Click on ¬¥Migrate existing project to Databricks¬¥

## Creating a new project or package
Now we have sous-chef setup, we can start creating new projects and packages using the `chef` cli.

To create a new project, run the new-service target from the command line and provide a name for your service:

```bash
chef create project
```

To create a new package:
```bash
chef create package
```

For more information about the `chef` cli, view [packages/`chef`/README.md](packages/chef/README.md)

### What is the difference between \<library name\>, \<package name\> and \<module name\>?

**Library** name is a human readable name. *E.g: Analytics API*

**Project** name is a name without spaces and upper letters for workflows and folders. *E.g: analytics-api*

**Module** name is the python package name which needs underscores. *E.g: analytics_api*

## Use Cases
In this secion will you find a few use-cases to describe how to develop different projects.

### Python Project
In this section will we showcase how to setup a simple ML application that.

#### Create the project
Make sure you have access to the `chef` cli.

> [!NOTE]
> If you do not have access to the `chef` cli. Try running the following:
> ```bash
> poetry shell
> poetry install
> ```

With the chef cli activated, run the following to create a new project:

```bash
chef create project
```

This will prompt you for different questions. However, it is mainly the `Project Name` that needs to be inputted. For the rest can you press `Enter`, unless you want to customise it futher.

The command will add a basic project structure needed for Python development, and a few files for basic development locally, and on Databricks.

#### Start developing
We are now ready to start adding our custom code.

Open up a new shell / terminal, and move into the project directory. This can be done by running:

```bash
cd projects/<your-project-name>
```

This project will have it's one Python environment, which prohibits conflicting Python packages across projects, but it also enable us to use different Python versions per project.

As a result, we need to create a new virtual environment, and install the project packages again. Therefore, run the following:

```bash
poetry shell
poetry install
```

We can now add external and internal packages with:

```bash
chef add data-contracts  # Internal package at `packages/data-contracts`
chef add streamlit       # External UI package
```

#### Example file

To showcase a simple example. Add the following streamlit app to `app.py`. This will search for recipe embeddings in a vector database.

```python
import asyncio
import streamlit as st

from project_owners.owner import Owner

from data_contracts.recommendations.recipe import RecipeFeatures
from data_contracts.recommendations.store import recommendation_feature_contracts

from aligned import feature_view, String, Bool, FileSource, model_contract
from aligned.exposed_model.ollama import ollama_embedding_contract
from aligned.sources.lancedb import LanceDBConfig

vector_db = LanceDBConfig(path="./vector_db")

recipe = RecipeFeatures()

RecipeEmbedding = ollama_embedding_contract(
    input=recipe.recipe_name,
    entities=recipe.recipe_id,
    model="nomic-embed-text",
    endpoint="http://our-embedding-service:11434",
    contract_name="recipe_embedding",
    contacts=[Owner.matsmoll().markdown()],
    output_source=vector_db.table("recipe_embeddings").as_vector_index("recipes")
)

async def main():
    recipe_to_search = "Laks med soya og ris"
    st.write(f"Searching for '{recipe_to_search}'")

    store = recommendation_feature_contracts()
    store.add_model(RecipeEmbedding)

    with st.spinner("Creating Embeddings"):
        await store.model("recipe_embedding").predict_over(
            RecipeFeatures.query().all()
        ).insert_into_output_source()

    similar_recipes = await (
        store.vector_index("recipes")
            .nearest_n_to({
                "recipe_name": [recipe_to_search],
                number_of_records=5
            }).to_pandas()
    )

    st.title("Similar recipes")
    st.write(similar_recipes)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

#### Run the project
With a small application can we run the project locally through docker. Howerver, we need to add the startup command to the `docker-compose.yaml` file first.

```yaml
services:
  app:
    platform: linux/amd64
    build:
      context: ../../
      dockerfile: projects/<project-name>/docker/Dockerfile
    volumes:
      - ./:/opt/projects/<project-name>/
      - ./../../packages:/opt/packages
    command: "python -m streamlit run app.py --server.fileWatcherType poll"

    depends_on:
      - base
    ports:
      - 8500:8501
    env_file:
      - ../../.env
      - .env

    ...
```

Now startup the application with:
```bash
chef up app
```
This will build the project, install everything that is needed and start up the server at `http://127.0.0.1:8500`.

### Data Science

Data science applications are a subtype of a Python project. Meaning you can use everything described in the Python Project use-case.
However, to manage the unpredicability of data and ML could the following also be needed:

 - Experiment tracking
 - Model versioning - through a model registry
 - Feature store - to load offline point-in-time data, and low latency online data.
 - Big Brain compute - aka. extra RAM / disk
 - Out of memory compute - through Spark / distributed processing
 - Job orchestration
 - Model serving enpoint
 - Monitor and validate data - either data drift or semantic expectations
 - Evaluate model online performance
 - Explain model outputs

For all of this do we default to the Databricks' components.

Meaning `MLFlow`, `Spark`, Databricks' `feature-engineering` package, `Databricks Asset Bundles`.
However, we still use `Docker` to controll the dependencies through the `docker/Dockerfile.databricks` file. See the [databricks-env README](https://github.com/cheffelo/sous-chef/tree/main/packages/databricks-env) for a more details.
