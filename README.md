# Sous Chef
Sous chef is the monorepo for the data team.

---

## Getting Started
Simply clone the repository and start by installing the `chef` cli tool.

The following script assumes that you have `poetry` and `pyenv` installed.

### Clone Repo
```bash
git clone https://github.com/cheffelo/sous-chef sous-chef
cd sous-chef
```

### Install Python and `chef` cli
```
poetry shell
poetry install --no-root
```

This will spin up a new Python virtualenv, and activate the venv in a new shell.
It will also install the core utils (`chef`) to manage the monorepo.

### Creating New Project and Packages
To create a new project, run the new-service target from the command line and provide a name for your service:

```shell
chef new project
```

To create a new package:
```shell
chef new package
```

#### What is the difference between <library name>, <package name> and <module name>?

Library name is a human readable name. *E.g: Analytics API*
Package name is a name without spaces and upper letters for workflows and folders. *E.g: analytics-api*
Module name is the python package name which needs underscores. *E.g: analytics_api*
